\title{Create an irregular sampling domain polygon}
\usage{
create_sampling_domain()
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object with one row and a \code{POLYGON} geometry.
}
\description{
Generates a single, closed, irregular polygon intended to represent a
realistic, non-rectangular study area for spatial simulation. The polygon
outline is derived from a parameterized radius-angle curve with added
sinusoidal perturbations and random noise to produce an "organic" shape.

The output is returned as an \code{sf} object containing one polygon in its
geometry column. This can be used directly in plotting or as the spatial
domain within which individuals, quadrats, or transects are placed.
}
\details{
The shape is generated in polar coordinates \eqn{(r, \theta)} using:
\itemize{
\item a base radius of 10 units,
\item sinusoidal radial modulations with periods of 3 and 5 cycles per
revolution,
\item independent uniform noise on both radius and Cartesian coordinates
to break symmetry,
\item vertical compression by a factor of 0.8 to induce aspect variation.
}
The 20 vertices are connected in sequence and closed by repeating the first
point. The result is wrapped in \code{sf::st_polygon()} and returned as a
single-row \code{sf} object.
