\title{Build a site-by-species abundance matrix from point–polygon overlaps}
\usage{
create_abundance_matrix(species_dist, quadrats, all_species_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_dist}{An \code{sf} POINT layer of individuals that contains a
character (or factor) column named \code{species}. Geometry must be in the
same CRS as \code{quadrats}.}

\item{quadrats}{An \code{sf} POLYGON (or MULTIPOLYGON) layer of sampling
units that contains an integer (or character) column named \code{quadrat_id}
identifying each site. Geometry must be in the same CRS as \code{species_dist}.}

\item{all_species_names}{Character vector giving the complete set of species
to include as columns (e.g., \code{LETTERS[1:S]}). Any species not present
in the intersections are still created as columns and zero-filled.}
}
\value{
A base \code{data.frame} with one row per quadrat and columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{site}}{Copy of \code{quadrat_id}.}
\item{\code{<species>}}{Non‑negative integer counts for each species in
\code{all_species_names}.}
}
}
\description{
Aggregates simulated individuals (\code{species_dist}, POINTS) into sampling
units (\code{quadrats}, POLYGONS) and returns a wide site × species table
(one row per quadrat; one column per species). Counts are computed via
spatial intersection; species absent from a quadrat are filled with zeros.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{\link[sf]{st_intersection}()} to associate each
individual with the quadrat polygon that contains it, then tallies counts by
\code{(quadrat_id, species)} and pivots to wide format. If no points fall in
any quadrat, the result is a data frame with one row per quadrat and zeros in
all species columns. Missing species columns (relative to \code{all_species_names})
are added and zero-filled to ensure a consistent schema.
}
\section{CRS}{

Inputs must share the same coordinate reference system. If they differ,
reproject beforehand (e.g., \code{species_dist <- sf::st_transform(species_dist, sf::st_crs(quadrats))}).
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
spp <- simulate_points() # must contain geometry + 'species'
quads <- make_quadrats() # must contain geometry + 'quadrat_id'
A <- create_abundance_matrix(spp, quads, all_species_names = LETTERS[1:10])
head(A)
