Description: Simulate and visualise spatial community sampling within an
    irregular domain. Species distributions are generated from a Fisher
    log-series and can include environmental filtering (multiple gradients),
    dominant-species clustering, and local interspecific interactions. Multiple
    quadrat placement schemes are provided (random, tiled, systematic, transect,
    Voronoi) to emulate common field designs. The package writes site-by-species
    abundance matrices and per-quadrat environmental summaries, and produces
    publication-quality maps and analysis panels (rank–abundance, occupancy–
    abundance, species–area, distance–decay, rarefaction). A single high-level
    runner orchestrates the full workflow from configuration files to figures
    and a human-readable report.
